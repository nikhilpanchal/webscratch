# Performance Evaluation

## Overview

Performance evaluation as the final step in Portfolio management, describes performance and analyzes why progress toward investor objectives turned out as it did. 
Such information is also useful in judging whether an investment manager is likely to help an investor reach his investment goals in the future.

## Component Activities

 * Performance Measurement
 * Performance Attribution
 * Performance Appraisal
 * Manager Selection
 * Investment Performance Presentation
 
### Performance Measurement

Performance measurement is concerned with the measurement of return and risk. Answers the question `What was the portfolio's past performance and what may be expected in the future?`
Deals with the calculation of `the rate of return`.

### Performance Attribution

Performance attribution is concerned with identifying and quantifying the sources of performance of a portfolio. Answers the question `How did the portfolio produce its observed performance and what are the expected sources of expected future performance?`
Attribution can be analyzed from two perspectives

 1. Return Attribution: The set techniques used to identify the sources of a portfolio's excess return. 
 Is typically only performed `ex-post`.
 1. Risk Attribution: The set of techniques used to identify and quantify the sources of investment risk in a portfolio as well as the impact of investment decisions contributing to the portfolio's total risk.
 Can be performed `ex-post` as well as `ex-ante`. 
 
### Performance Appraisal
 
Appraisal is concerned with identifying and measuring the investment skill. Answers the question `Was the observed investment portfolio's performance the result of investment skill or luck?`. Performance Appraisal as a process comes after measure and attribution are performed.
 
As one would expect the bulk of performance appraisal's focus is on identifying and quantifying the skill of `Active Portfolio` managers seeking to beat the benchmark rather than `Passive` ones that seek to match it.
 
Performance appraisal treats returns in conjunction with risk: Were the returns commensurate for the risks taken? Appraisal may also involve making a full adjustment to the returns for the risks incurred. 
 
### Manager Selection
Goes hand in had with performance appraisal. Answers the question `What managers should be hired, retained or fired ?`

### Investment Performance Presentation
`What performance information should be presented? In what way?`   

## RoR Methodologies

### Time Weighted Rate of Return
The compound rate of growth of *one unit* of money invested in the portfolio at the start of the measurement period. Is not affected by external cash flows.

### Money Weighted Rate of Return 
The compound rate of growth that would produce the ending value of the portfolio given the timing and magnitude of all cash flows during the measurement period. Takes external cash flows into account (by definition).

## Risk Measurement
Two broad categories

### Absolute Risk
Measurement of the risk of the portfolio on a standalone basis

### Relative Risk
Measurement of risk of the portfolio as compared to a benchmark
