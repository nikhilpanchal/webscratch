# Rate of Return Measurement

Rate of Return (RoR) on an investment over a time period is the percent gain or loss in wealth resulting from holding that investment over that time period.
An essential first step in performance evaluation, it is an important metric calculated from other basic, more primitive data.

## Single Period Rate of Return
The primary input to the rate of return is the portfolio value over time. The portfolio value is calculated as the sum of the values of the individual securities (holdings) of the portfolio.

The holding period rate of return is the ratio of the change (gain or loss) in value of the portfolio divided by the original portfolio value at the start of the holding period.

```
R = V1 - V0 / V0    or ((V1/V0) - 1) 
```

It is important to note that V1 must include any income received by the portfolio during the holding period. This is the investment income, which is different from deposits or withdrawls from a portfolio which are termed as external cash flows.
Thus the total return of the portfolio comprises the **capital gains return** (which results from the change in asset prices) and **income return** (which comes from the investment income generated by the assets --- like dividends etc.).

### Investment Income
To account for the investment income the timing of the investment income matters.

#### Income at the end of the holding period.
If it occurs at the end of the holding period, it could simply be added to the final valuation of the portfolio.

```
R = V1 - V0 + D / V0   or (((V1 - V0)/V0) + D/V0)
```

#### Income occuring during the holding period that is re-invested
In this case, the portfolio value at the end would represent the price appreciation from the original capital investment, plus the value of the additional assets purchased with the reinvested income.

Two Cases:
1. Any gains from reinvested income are included in the income return
1. Any gains from reinvested income are included in the price return
