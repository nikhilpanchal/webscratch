# Rate of Return Measurement

Rate of Return (RoR) on an investment over a time period is the percent gain or loss in wealth resulting from holding that investment over that time period.
An essential first step in performance evaluation, it is an important metric calculated from other basic, more primitive data.

## Single Period Rate of Return
The primary input to the rate of return is the portfolio value over time. The portfolio value is calculated as the sum of the values of the individual securities (holdings) of the portfolio.

The holding period rate of return is the ratio of the change (gain or loss) in value of the portfolio divided by the original portfolio value at the start of the holding period.

```
R = V1 - V0 / V0    or ((V1/V0) - 1) 
```

It is important to note that V1 must include any income received by the portfolio during the holding period. This is the investment income, which is different from deposits or withdrawls from a portfolio which are termed as external cash flows.
Thus the total return of the portfolio comprises the **capital gains return** or **price return** (which results from the change in asset prices) and **income return** (which comes from the investment income generated by the assets --- like dividends etc.). 

### Investment Income
To account for the investment income the timing of the investment income matters.

#### Income at the end of the holding period.
If it occurs at the end of the holding period, it could simply be added to the final valuation of the portfolio.

```
R = V1 - V0 + D / V0   or (((V1 - V0)/V0) + D/V0)
```

#### Income occuring during the holding period that is re-invested
In this case, the portfolio value at the end would represent the price appreciation from the original capital investment, plus the value of the additional assets purchased with the reinvested income.

Two Cases:
 * Any gains from reinvested income are included in the income return
 
```
R = (V1 - V0 / V0) - (V1x - V0x / V0x)  // Total return - Price return gives income return
                                        // Income return will include the re-investment return   
```

 * Any gains from reinvested income are included in the price return

```
R = V1 - V0 -D / V0       // Price Return  (leave gain from re-investment in, just take out the income component)
R = D / V0                // Income Return
```

Note that in both cases, the actual income received by the portfolio will always be the basis of the income return. The points above simply determine how to classify the capital gains (or losses) on the income re-invested. 

### Multi-Asset Portfolio
The return on a portfolio that holds multiple assets is calculated as the weighted sum of the return in each of the individual assets. Here the weights are the **beginning-of-period portfolio weights** for the assets.

```
Rp = Sigma(wi,Ri)
```

### Common Stock
When a stock has a dividend declared (at the ex-dividend date), if a portfolio has a holding period on the stock prior to the Ex-dividend date and ending after the ex-dividend but before the pay date, the dividend must be included in the ending value of the stock as accrued income.

### Bonds
To calculate the return of a bond, you need to take into account, the **accrued interest** resulting from coupon payments for the entirety of the holding period. This is different from stocks where it depends whether you held the stock before or after the ex-dividend date.
The accrued interest, or a share of the interest payment, is the interest payment calculated proportionally to the fraction of days between interest payments that the bond was held.

```
Rbond = Ending dirty price - Beginning Dirty Price / Beginning Dirty Price      // Total Return

      = Ending Clean Price - Beignning Clean Price / BEiggning Dirty Price      // Price Return
      + Ending Accrued Interest - Beginning Accrued Interest / Beginning Dirty Price    // Income Return
```

### Cash (Liquidity Reserve)
Can earn interest. Increases when income from assets is received (dividends, coupon payments, etc.), or when assets are sold, or when external money is deposited. Decreases when assets are purchased or money is withdrawn (external)

### Foreign Assets
Foreign or Domestic Assets are classified relative to the domicility of the investor. The return of foreign assets in the foreign currency is deemed its **Local Currency Return**. This can be restated as the **Domestic Currency Return** by converting it to base currency of the investor using the  **Spot Exchange Rate**

```
Rbase = V1foreign * Spot Domestic/Foreign / V0foerign * Spot Domestic/Foreign  - 1

Return in Local Currency = ViForeign/V0Foreign - 1

Currency Return = Spot1 Domestic/Foreign / Sport0 Domestic/Foreign  - 1

Total Return = (1 + Return in Local Currency) (1 + Currency Return) - 1
             = Return in Local Currency + Currency Return + (Return in Local Currency)(Currency Return)
``` 

### Short and Leveraged Positions
Short positions, represents owning a negative position in an asset -- Like Selling a stock short. Its return is calculated the usual way, however when combined with other assets in a portfolio it would have a negative weight.

Leverage is the use of borrowing, or purchasing assets on a margin to maginify gains or losses.

```
R Cash Basis = V1 - V0 / V0  where V0 is the sum of the invested capital and the borrowed funds (total investment)

R Levegerage = V1 - Interest payment on cash borrowed / Invested Capital
             = R Cash basis - (Interest Rate)(Leverage Ratio) / ( 1 - Leverage Ratio)
             
Leverage Ratio = Market Value of Debt / Market Value of Debt + Market Value of Equity  
```
